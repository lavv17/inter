This is Inter library. Copyright (c) 1994-95 Alexander V. Lukyanov

It can be compiled on DOS using Turbo C or DJGPP compilers and on UNIX
(Linux) with Curses library. Cygwin compilation is most probably possible,
but I have not tried it.

This library is distributed under GNU LGPL license (see COPYING.LIB).

See also my Life program, which makes use of this library.
